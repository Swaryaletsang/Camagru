# Camagru

My own INSTAGRAM !

This is the fist projet right after the PHP Bootcamp, We have to create, with php and some JavaScript a litle Instagram website.
Users can take a webcam shot and then do some "photo-montage", pictures will pop in the public gallery and users can comment, like or delete their post.
Frameworks are forbidden so we have to do everything. from registration to css style.
100% responsive.

How to use?
Clone

This is a PHP project so you have to start LAMP, MAMP, WAMP or other apache server. Then you can clone this repo in your apache diretory like htdocs for MAMP.

  git clone -b Swaryaletsang https://github.com/Swaryaletsang/Camagru.git Instagru

Then you must go to localhost:/Instagru/config/ to install the database and fill it.

Once your database is created you can create an account and ENJOY.
